# Nexus: A Klaytn-Native Metaverse Marketplace

### Context
According to industry experts, the metaverse is expected to infiltrate a multitude of industries in numerous ways in the coming years, with the potential market opportunity at more than USD 1 trillion in yearly revenues.

### Problem
Klaytn is poised to become one of the largest ecosystems in Web3 due to its unique position as the blockchain for the metaverse. One of the most important parts of a blockchain-powered metaverse is that the in-metaverse assets are non-fungible and verified on-chain. This enables users to purchase unique items such as clothing, furniture, housing, and land in the digital space. However, currently there is no established marketplace to mint, trade, and display 3D NFTs in a manner that is interoperable across all metaverse platforms.

### Vision
This is why we've built Nexus. A Klaytn-native 3D asset marketplace for users in the metaverse to seamlessly create, trade, and showcase their 3D metaverse assets.

Some of the features include but are not limited to:
- No-code minting of 3D NFTs (metadata hosted on-chain via IPFS)
- Showcasing of owned 3D NFT assets via user profiles
- Seamless buying and selling of 3D NFTs
- Well-documented API to integrated Nexus 3D NFTs into any metaverse

The vision of Nexus is to become the one-stop shop to serve all Klaytn-based metaverse platforms for their on-chain asset needs. We are extremely excited to showcase this prototype and would love to hear feedback from the Klaytn core team.

### Next Steps
- Rigorous user testing and feedback with users
- Adding programmatic batch minting NFTs
- Support metaverse asset conversions (i.e. .gltf/.glb, .obj, .fbx)
- Adding NFT analytics (price appraisal, floor price tracking)
- Adding advanced trading options (limit trades, auctions)
- Adding social features (follow, like, comment on assets)
- Creating an interoperable 3D NFT metadata standard for Klaytn
- Support for dynamic 3D NFTs that evolve with on-chain data
